In a perfect world, there would be some sort of flexible/resizable electronic device on which we can draw. Drawing on such a device would be much like using a computer mouse and would enable you to directly design applications, but with the same ease that you have when using a pen and paper.

Some electronic devices almost do that, but they're not perfect, and pretty expensive.

My team and I think that while the perfect drawing electronic device doesn't exist, using your pen and paper is pretty efficient. The problem with the paper is that it doesn't enable you to use any tool that a computer program would give you.

The goal of this project is to fill this gap. We're aiming at developing a system that with allow anyone, from a user-friendly web-based front-end, to go from your napkin sketch to anything that you'd like, being some OpenOffice document, or a starting base of code for your projects.
